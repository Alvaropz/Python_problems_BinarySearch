'''
You are given a list of integers fighters and a two dimensional list bosses. The fighters list contains 1s and 0s with a 1 representing a fighter. Similarly, each bosses list contains 1s and 0s with a 1 representing a boss.

Given that fighters can beat a bosses row if it contains more fighters than bosses, return a new bosses matrix with defeated boss rows removed.
