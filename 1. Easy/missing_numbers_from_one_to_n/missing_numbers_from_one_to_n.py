'''
You are given a list of integers nums of length n where all numbers in the list are from the interval [1, n][1,n] and some elements appear twice while others only once. Return all the numbers from [1, n][1,n] that are not in the list, sorted in ascending order.

Can you do it in \mathcal{O}(n)O(n) time, modify nums in-place and use \mathcal{O}(1)O(1) additional space?
