'''
You are given a list of lists fractions where each list contains [numerator, denominator] which represents the number numerator / denominator.

Return a new list of lists such that the numbers in fractions are:

In their most reduced terms. E.g. 8 / 6 becomes 4 / 3.
Any duplicate fractions that represent the same value are removed.
Sorted in ascending order by their value.
If the number is negative, the - sign should go to the numerator (the input also follows this).
