## General Info:

This is a series of problems with different difficulty levels provided by BinarySearch where I use my current knwoledge in Python to solve them. 

This website checks your code performance such as how much time takes for your code to be run compared with professional code. I include the performance percentage (on average) for that code. 

Furthermore, I wrote additional tests for every program to check if the code is successful.
