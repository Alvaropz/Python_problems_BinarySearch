'''
You are given a list of integers positions representing the position of a car at equally spaced intervals of time. 

Return the length of the longest sublist where the car was traveling at a constant speed.

Input: positions = [0, 3, 6, 5, 4, 3, 1, 7, 10, 13]
Ouput: 4
The longest period the car was traveling at a constant speed was in the sublist [6, 5, 4, 3]
